# AI-Based Fraud Detection for Financial Transactions

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an AI-based fraud detection system for financial transactions. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze transactional data and identify potentially fraudulent activities.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess transactional data to prepare it for model training.
- Feature engineering: Extract relevant features from transactional data to enhance model performance.
- Model training: Train machine learning models using various algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- Model evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Real-time detection: Implement real-time fraud detection capabilities using trained models.
- Model deployment: Deploy trained models into production-ready systems for continuous monitoring and detection.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Use `data_preprocessing.py` to clean and preprocess the transactional data.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Run `feature_engineering.py` to extract relevant features from the preprocessed data.

3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using `model_training.py`. Specify the desired algorithm and hyperparameters.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using `model_evaluation.py`. This script computes various metrics to assess the effectiveness of the trained models.

5. **Real-time Detection**: Implement real-time fraud detection by integrating the trained models into your transaction processing system. Use `real_time_detection.py` as a reference implementation.

## Dataset

The system is designed to work with transactional data in CSV format. Ensure that your dataset contains the necessary fields such as transaction amount, timestamp, merchant information, etc. Sample datasets can be found in the `data` directory.
